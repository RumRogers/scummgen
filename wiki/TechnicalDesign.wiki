#summary Architecture of the project

The following explains the design of ScummGEN.
The project is divided into two sub-parts : the *editors* and the *assembler*.

----

= Editors =

== Description ==

Currently, no editor has been made. In the future, ScummGEN will have a set of editors which will allow the user to create a fully working SCUMM v6 game. Their role will be to easily create game contents and export them to a folder which will then be fed into the assembler described later.

== Folder hierarchy ==

The folder (which might turn into some tar-like file in the future) created by the set of editors is organized like this :

 * *_game_*
   * game.xml
   * *charsets*
     * charsets.xml
     * *_charset_* {{{*}}}
       * charset.xml
       * charset.bmp
   * *rooms*
     * rooms.xml
     * *_room_* {{{*}}}
       * background.bmp
       * map.xml
       * palette.xml
       * room.xml
       * *costumes*
         * costumes.xml
         * *_costume_* {{{*}}}
           * costume.xml
           * frame{{{_}}}_xxx_.bmp {{{*}}}
       * *objects*
         * objects.xml
         * *_object_* {{{*}}}
           * object.xml
           * verb.sgc
           * *images*
             * images.xml
             * *_image_* {{{*}}}
               * image.bmp
               * *zplanes*
                 * zplane{{{_}}}_xxx_.bmp {{{*}}}
       * *scripts*
         * entry.sgc
         * exit.sgc
         * scripts.xml
         * _script_.sgc {{{*}}}
       * *zplanes*
         * zplane{{{_}}}_xxx_.bmp {{{*}}}
   * *scripts*
     * scripts.xml
     * _script_.sgc {{{*}}}
   * *voices*
     * voice.xml
     * *_voice_* {{{*}}}
       * voice.wav
       * voice.xml
